Ollie is a boilerplate for creating rapid Single Page Application wireframes and microsites. It uses Ares.js and Retto.css micro-libraries.
You can think of this as a very light HTML5 + Bootstrap + jQuery boilerplate but reduced down to only the functional aspects each bring to the table.
Ollie scaffolds the build, linting, testing processes.
